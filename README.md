#### What the four pillars of OOP
- Abstraction
- Inheritance 
  Inheritance in OOP 
  e.g created data in student 1 
  if we created a class called person and in the person's class, we created vairables called name, DOB, Address, Gender.
  We inherited all those things, we don't need to rewrite.
  When want to create, you do import person from person
  Then you can create seperate class
  You can inherit a child class from parent class
  
-Encapsulation 
 Hiding the data from the user - when you would like to restrit information 
e.g bank => only the user can see their own information
you would do this by putting an underscore to make it private 
_dob = 01/01/1991
-Polymorphism 
you would like create more functiontionalities 
youre not changing anything in the parent class, but inheriting more to put into parent class 

super class

base class
parent class
child class
